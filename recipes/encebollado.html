          <p>Encebollado de pescado is one of my favorite soups, the name is hard to translate, and
            literally it could be translated as oniony
            fish soup. Encebollado is made with fresh tuna, yuca or
            cassava root, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, spices and is served with
            curtido or pickled onions and tomatoes on top or mixed in with the soup.
            The pickled or lime marinated red onions are what give it the name “encebollado”.
            It is a typical soup from the coastal region in Ecuador.</p>
          <p>This Ecuadorian tuna fish soup is very versatile
            and can be served for lunch, dinner and even breakfast
            or brunch. In fact it is known as the best hangover
            cure (like so many other Ecuadorian dishes); and
            restaurants that specialize
            in encebollado begin serving it in the early morning.</p>

            You can also additional herbs to the broth, but cilantro is the main one. </p>
