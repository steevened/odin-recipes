          <p>Ecuadorian pan de yuca are small cheesy
            breads made with yuca flour (cassava/tapioca starch)
            and cheese. There are variations of these delicious
            breads in many Latin countries. They are known as
            chipas in Paraguay/Argentina, pan de queso in Colombia,
            cuñape in Bolivia, and pao de queijo in Brazil. The
            variations and exact ingredients vary from one place to
            another, my recipe for pan de yuca is made
            with yuca starch, cheese, butter and eggs.</p>
          <p>Yuca bread makes a delicious warm appetizer and the
            breads can be made in advance and baked minutes before
            serving. Leftover breads will get hard when they get
            cold, but can be reheated in the microwave (great
            for breakfast the day after). The flour is made from
            yuca root, and is also known as cassava or tapioca
            starch, the flour can be found in most
            supermarkets, in Latin grocery stores, or online. </p>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Combine the yuca starch or flour, cheese, baking powder and salt in a food processor, blend to mix well.
            </li>
            <li>Add the butter and eggs.</li>
            <li>Mix until small dough balls begin to form, if it's too dry add 1-2 tablespoons of water or milk. Add
              more if needed.</li>
            <li>Remove the dough from the food processor and roll into a ball, you can make the dough ahead and store in
              the refrigerator for up to a day.</li>
            <li>To make the dough by hand, combine all the ingredients in large bowl, using melted (cooled down) butter,
              and mix until you have a smooth dough. It's actually very easy to prepare by hand.</li>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 500 F.</li>
            <li>Make small round shaped breads with the dough and place on a cookie sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Bake immediately or store in the fridge until ready to bake. I find that they turn out best if you do
              let them chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes before baking.</li>
            <li>Once the oven reaches 500F, turn on broiler, place the breads on the middle rack and bake until the
              breads are golden, about 5-7 minutes. Another option is to pre-heat the oven to 400F and bake at 400F for
              about 5 minutes and then turn on the broiler.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, can be served alone or with tree tomato aji.</li>
