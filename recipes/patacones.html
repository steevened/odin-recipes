          <p>Patacones or tostones are fried green plantain slices, and unlike chifles – very thin green bananas or
            green plantain chips- patacones are thicker and are always made with green plantains (unlike chifles which
            can be made with green bananas), the most typical way to make patacones is to fry them once, remove them
            from the hot oil, smash them with a wood mortar and pestle to flatten them a little – the bottom of glass
            jar or glass also works-and fry them again until crispy. Tostones are very easy to make and probably way
            past due to be posted here since I’ve mentioned them already as suggested side dishes for quite a few
            different recipes.</p>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <h3>Twice fried method for patacones or tostones:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Peel the plantains, the easiest way to peel a green plantain is to make the lengthwise cut on one of the
              angles, the cut should be skin deep without touching the actual flesh of the plantain, then use the knife
              to raise the skin and peel it off.</li>
            <li>Cut the plantains into thick slices, you can make straight cuts or slightly diagonal cuts.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil over medium high heat in a frying pan – use enough oil to almost cover the plantain slices
              - or a deep fryer, temperature should be about 350 F, fry the plantains until they start to get yellow,
              but not golden.</li>
            <li>Remove the plantains and place on paper towels to drain the oil.</li>
            <li>Use the bottom of a glass (or small bowl or a wood pestle) to smash and flatten the plantains, do this
              gently to keep the slices from breaking, a few cracks is ok as long as the whole slice remains in one
              piece. It is best to do this when they are still warm.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the plantain slices with salt and other seasonings (if using the raw garlic rub it on the
              slices).</li>
            <li>Reheat the oil, temperature should be about 375 F and fry the plantains until golden on each side, about
              1-2 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oil, drain again on paper towels, and add additional seasoning if needed.</li>
            <li>Serve warm as a side dish or as an appetizer with dipping sauces.</li>
          </ol>
