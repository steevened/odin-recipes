  <h2>Ecuadorian shrimp ceviche {Ceviche de camarón}</h1>
    <p>Shrimp ceviche or ceviche de camaron is one of the most popular Ecuadorian ceviches. Ceviches, also known as cebiches (both spellings are acceptable), are very popular all around Ecuador, but especially at the beach. One of the great things about this type of Ecuadorian ceviche is that the shrimp are already cooked.</p>
    <p>So if you have any health concerns or aren’t comfortable with the idea of trying to make homemade fish ceviche – which is typically raw fish “cooked” by the acidity of lime juice – then this one is perfect for you, especially if you want to try it for the first time. Of course making fish ceviche with fresh high quality sushi grade fish and keeping it refrigerated makes it safer to prepare and eat at home. Once you are comfortable with the shrimp variation I recommend that you try the fish one.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 green plantains peeled and cut in medium sized chunks</li>
    <li>4-5 tbs butter or lard</li>
    <li>2 tbs oil canola or sunflower</li>
    <li>1 tbs hot pepper or chili powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
    <li>1 cup grated cheese and/or 1 cup cooked chorizo or chicharrones (fried pork belly) or bacon</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Ground peanuts optional – add when mashing the green plantains</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Melt the butter or lard over medium heat in large sauté pan</li>
    <li>Add the plantain chunks and cook for about 40 minutes or until they are very soft, turn them about every 10 minutes, they should be slightly golden but not too crispy.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the cooked plantains with the chili powder, cumin and salt.</li>
    <li>Transfer the plantain pieces to a bowl, do this while they are still hot (but be careful not to burn yourself).</li>
    <li>Mash the plantains using a wood masher – or just a regular potato masher – until you obtain chunky dough like consistency.</li>
    <li>Form balls slightly smaller than the size of a tennis ball with the dough.</li>
    <li>Make a hole in the middle of each ball and fill it with the cheese or chorizo or chicharrones (mixed with ground peanuts), gently press the filling into the hole, cover the filling and reshape it back into a ball shape.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil over high heat, add the stuffed plantain dumplings and fry them until they are golden and crispy on each side.</li>
    <li>Transfer to plate lined with paper towels to drain the grease and serve immediately.</li>
  </ol>
