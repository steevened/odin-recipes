          <p>Shrimp ceviche or ceviche de camaron is one of the most popular Ecuadorian ceviches. Ceviches,
            also known as cebiches (both spellings are acceptable), are very popular all around Ecuador, but
            especially at the beach. One of the great things about this type of
            Ecuadorian ceviche is that the shrimp are already cooked.</p>
          <p>So if you have any health concerns or aren’t comfortable with the idea of trying to make homemade fish
            ceviche – which is typically raw fish “cooked” by the acidity of lime juice – then
            this one is perfect for you, especially if you want to try it for the first time. Of course
            making fish ceviche with fresh high quality sushi grade fish and keeping it refrigerated makes it safer to
            prepare and eat at home. Once you are comfortable with the shrimp variation I recommend that you try the
            fish one.</p>

          <h4>Notes</h4>
          <p>You can add some of the broth from cookin
            g the shrimp to the ceviche marinade for e
            xtra shrimp flavor. You can also blend the shrimp peels/heads with a fresh tomato and some broth - strain it
            and use this mix instead of the ketchup.</p>
